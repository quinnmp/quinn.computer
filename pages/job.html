    <em>August 2021 - April 2023</em><br />
    At this job, I worked as a computer science tutor with young children and
    taught them the basics of coding. I used languages like Python and Scratch
    to introduce them to basic programming concepts. I worked with ages from
    pre-school to middle, and I learned a ton about lesson planning and
    leadership.
