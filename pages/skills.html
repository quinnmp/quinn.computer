<h4>Skills</h4>
<h5>Courses</h5>
<p>
    I took
    <strong>Calculus 1-3</strong> along with <strong>Linear Algebra</strong> at
    Everett Community College.<br /><br />

    Additionally, I completed nearly every CS course that EvCC had to offer,
    including their most difficult,
    <strong
        >CS244 - Advanced Data Structures and Introduction to Algorithms
        Java</strong
    >. This course covered a large variety of fundamental CS topics, such Big O
    notation, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, and many other data
    structures.<br /><br />
</p>

<h5>Web Development</h5>
<p>
    I taught myself full-stack web development. I consider myself proficient in
    using tools like
    <strong
        >HTML, CSS, EJS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, React, Node.js,
        Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose</strong
    >. Additionally, I have much experience in
    <strong>interfacing with APIs</strong>. See <em>Contact</em> for a link to
    my GitHub where some of my web development work is hosted.<br /><br />
</p>

<h5>Robotics</h5>
<p>
    See <em>Robotics</em> for more information on my experience with robots.
    Through my time as the lead software developer on my robotics team, I
    learned <strong>Java</strong> at a high level. I also learned how to use
    <strong>libraries</strong> and
    <strong>interface with sensors and motors</strong>
    using these libraries and hardware clients. I learned how to develop code
    for
    <strong>autonomous motion</strong>
    through path planning and trajectory following, along with
    <strong>computer vision</strong> to target goals or re-localize the position
    of the robot on the field. I've learned how to program
    <strong>embedded systems</strong>, <strong>motor controllers</strong>, and
    <strong>finite state machines</strong>, along with
    <strong>control systems</strong> using things like a
    <strong>PID controller</strong>.

    I even learned how to program
    <strong>Android apps</strong> for use in our "scouting app", which makes use
    of QR codes to wirelessly transfer data about other robots, collected
    through the app by "scouts".<br /><br />
</p>

<h5>Soft Skills</h5>
<p>
    Through my time as a tutor (see
    <em>Job History</em>) and having a leadership position on my robotics team,
    I've picked up many soft skills. I've gotten good at
    <strong>public speaking</strong> along with things like
    <strong>teamwork</strong>, <strong>leadership</strong>, and
    <strong>conflict resolution</strong>. Robotics is also very fast-paced,
    demanding strong <strong>planning</strong> and
    <strong>communication</strong>
    skills<br /><br />

    Additionally, as a student, I've gotten very good at
    <strong>time-management</strong>, <strong>critical-thinking</strong>, and
    <strong>self-motivation</strong>. I find that these skills are crucial to
    have in almost all areas of life, and I pride myself on them.
