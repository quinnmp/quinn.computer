<h4>Academics</h4>
<p>
    A major focus of my life has been my academics. I really enjoy learning,
    especially when it comes to STEM fields.<br />

    In my Junior year of high school, I decided to take part in my school's
    <strong>Running Start</strong> program. I went full-time my Senior year, and
    in total, I had enough college credits to graduate with an Associate degree
    simultaneously with my high school graduation.<br />

    Additionally, I maintained a perfect
    <strong>4.0 GPA</strong> in both my high school and Running Start courses.
    This earned me the title of <strong>Valedictorian</strong> with my high
    school, and earned me the <strong>President's Distinction</strong> at my
    Running Start college.<br />
