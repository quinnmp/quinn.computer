<h4>UWROV</h4>
<p>
    Very similar to <strong>Husky Robotics</strong>, I immediately applied to
    the
    <a href="https://uwrov.org/"
        ><strong>Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicles Team</strong></a
    >
    as soon as I could. This team focuses on underwater robots and is a
    <strong>world-class team</strong> in terms of robot performance and
    documentation.<br />
    My role as a software developer on this team has largely been in the realm
    of computer vision, both in the fields of
    <strong>Structure from Motion</strong> (underwater position localization)
    and <strong>Photogrammetry</strong> (creating 3D models of the sea floor and
    structures on it). Below is an example of some of the 3D reconstruction work
    I've been doing. This image features a pipe structure used to mimick coral,
    captured from a camera mounted on the bottom of the ROV.
