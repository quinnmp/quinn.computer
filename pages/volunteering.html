<h4>Volunteering</h4>
<p>
    Not only did I participate in FIRST robotics as a student, see
    <em>Robotics</em>, I also spent much time volunteering at competitions. I
    volunteered at all levels of competition and in numerous different roles.

    I really enjoyed volunteering at FIRST competitions. I saw myself in the
    students there, and I loved being able to give back to the community that
    gave so much to me. These competitions are generally full-day events, so
    I've likely spent cumulatively 100-200 hours volunteering for FIRST. Below
    is a list of roles I've filled.<br />
</p>

<h4>Roles</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Queuer</strong><br />
    Teams need to know where to go, whether it's time for them to play a match
    or time for them to present a project in front of a panel of judges. As a
    Queuer, you make sure every team gets where they need to be. It involves
    working collaboratively with a large group of other Queuers to ensure a
    competition runs smoothly.<br />

    <strong>Set-up and tear-down</strong><br />
    These play-fields can be very in-depth. At the level of FRC, they are
    generally the size of a basketball court, and there are often multiple
    fields. Essentially, you have to turn a school's gymnasium into an arena for
    these games along with a "pit" area where teams stay between matches. I've
    spent much time helping set-up and tear-down these events.<br />

    <strong>Judge</strong><br />
    At earlier levels of FIRST, students are tasked to come up with some
    STEM-related solution to a world dilemma, such as producing clean energy or
    transportation. They create a presentation and present it to a board of
    "judges" who grade their solution. I volunteered as one of these judges.<br />

    <strong>Referee</strong><br />
    It's imperative to ensure that all rules are being followed to a T during
    robotics matches. I filled the role of a referee, ensuring that all teams
    were playing the game as intended. This is important to ensure the creation
    of a playing field that feels level and fair.<br />
</p>

<h5>Outreach</h5>
<p>
    In my time on my robotics team, I participated in many "outreach" events in
    which we bring our robot to an event or location and demonstrate its
    abilities. The goal of these events is to instill interest in STEM to
    children who may not have had much exposure to the field.<br />

    My team and I went to the
    <strong>Imagine Children's Museum</strong>
    in Everett, <strong>Seafair</strong> in Seattle,
    <strong>Boeing Family Day</strong>, and even lower-level FIRST competitions
    hosted by our school district. There's really nothing more rewarding than
    seeing young people show interest in a program I work so closely with.

    I even got the chance to lead a presentation at
    <strong>Nintendo of America</strong>
    regarding the software of our robot, which was an extremely valuable
    experience.
