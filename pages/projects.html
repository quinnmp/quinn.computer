    See <em>Robotics</em> for more information. I worked very closely with this
    code, I wrote probably 80-90% of it, as our programming team was small this
    year. This code won multiple awards and brought our robot to a 3rd place
    victory at the world championship.<br />

    This code I wrote much less of. That's because our programming team grew
    quite large and I took on a much more logistics-based role, overseeing and
    mentoring less experienced programmers. This code also won an award and
    brought our team many 1st place victories.<br />

    This is a React-based website that makes use of the Spotify and Genius
    Lyrics APIs to create an environment in which users can take notes on songs
    as they listen to them. There are too many features to name here, see the
    README.md in the repository. It makes use of MongoDB to store user notes.<br />

    This is a blog I made to host my reviews of albums. I loaded this with
    features, such as timestamp buttons which make use of the YouTube API which
    allows users to listen to sections of songs embedded into the review. This
    also uses MongoDB to store reviews.<br />

    This is a silly little project I made which can convert uploaded images or
    drawn images into ASCII art. It makes use of mostly vanilla JS and MongoDB.
