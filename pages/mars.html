<h4>Husky Robotics</h4>
<p>
    Immediately upon arriving at the University of Washington, I applied to and
    joined
    <strong><a href="https://www.huskyrobotics.me/">Husky Robotics</a></strong
    >, a robotics team that builds imitation Mars Rovers that compete in one or
    two competitions each each. This team has consistently ranked among the best
    in the world, and I'm very excited to continue in my role as a software
    developer for this team. <br />
    <br />
    My contributions to the team so far have been all over the place, from
    rewriting the logging infrastructure to provisioning NVIDIA Jetsons for use
    on the rover.
