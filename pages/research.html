<h4>Research</h4>
<p>
    Since October 2023, I have been doing research with the
    <a href="https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/"
        >Personal Robotics Lab</a
    >
    and the <a href="https://weirdlab.cs.washington.edu/">WEIRD Lab</a> in
    association with the Paul G. Allen School at UW. I have had the priviledge
    of working with Professors
    <a href="https://goodrobot.ai/"><strong>Siddhartha Srinivasa</strong></a>
    and
    <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~abhgupta/"
        ><strong>Abhishek Gupta</strong></a
    >. <br />

    My research has covered many domains of robotics - my first major project
    was a complete Inverse Kinematics Solver overhaul for our
    <a href="https://goodcherrybot.github.io/">chopsticks robot</a>, Tycho. I
    implemented a <strong>novel</strong> method of using
    <strong
        >simulator end effector control to solve IK in a simulated
        environment</strong
    >. Additionally, I worked on a paper on
    <strong>Continuity-Based Corrective Labels</strong> in the context of
    <strong>Robot Behavior Cloning</strong>, awaiting acceptance into IROS 2024
    (this site will be updated with the link). See

    for a quick write-up explaining my simulator-based IK solver.
